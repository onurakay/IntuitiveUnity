  question: What is the benefit of using the Observer Pattern in Unity game development?
  answers:
  - It optimizes memory usage by sharing data between objects
  - It simplifies the creation of new GameObjects during runtime
  - It enhances the visual quality of in-game assets and animations
  - It allows different parts of the game to respond to events or changes in state
    without being tightly coupled to the object generating those events
